THIS IS AN EVENT STAKING CONTRACT WHEREBY USERS PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TOKENS
BEFOREHAND TO ATTEND AN EVENT THATS YET TO HAPPEN
BEFORE ONE CAN BE ADMITTED 
A USER CAN SET UP THEIR OWN EVENT SO PEOPLE CAN ATTEND 
USERS CAN JOIN MULTIPLE EVENTS AT THE SAME TIME AND WHEN THEY JOIN THEY RECIEVE THEIR TOKENS BACK

NOTE I WILL BE USING THE (BURN AND MINT) FEATURE FOR TOKEN TRANSFERS I PERSONALLY PREFER THEM 
THE TRANSFER FROM FEATURE IS A PAIN TO USE BTW

LIKE THEY SAY IF CODE WORKS DONT CHANGE IT
