THIS IS AN EVENT STAKING CONTRACT WHEREBY USERS PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TOKENS
TO ATTEND AN EVENT 
BEFORE ONE CAN BE ADMITTED 
A USER CAN SET UP THEIR OWN EVENT SO PEOPLE CAN ATTEND ALSO *NOTE* THE FEE WHEN CREATING AN EVENT IS IN TOKENS NOT ETH
USERS CAN JOIN MULTIPLE EVENTS AT THE SAME TIME

NOTE I WILL BE USING THE (BURN AND MINT) FEATURE FOR TOKEN TRANSFERS I PERSONALLY PREFER THEM 
THE TRANSFER FROM FEATURE IS A PAIN TO USE BTW

LIKE THEY SAY IF CODE WORKS DONT CHANGE IT

ALSO YOU NEED TO BUY TOKENS TO ATTEND AN EVENT NO WORKAROUND 
FOR I AM THE CODEMASTER.....LOL

YOU CAN READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE
IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND 
JUST READ IT AGAIN
